#now we are going to learn input variables where we take the inputs from the users.

# name= input(" What is your name? ")
# print(name)


# cattle_farm = input(" How many cows are there ? ")
# Answer= " Oh That's Great"
# print(Answer, cattle_farm)

#2nd stage of input variable
# name= input("What is your name? ")
# greetings= "Hello Dears"
# print(greetings, name)

#another way of executing 2nd stage variables
# cows= input("How many cows are there? ")
# print("oh that's great", cows)


#3rd stage input variables
# name= input("What is your name? ")
# age= input("How old are you? ")
# greetings= "Hello!"
# print(greetings, name, age, "You're still a young man")
