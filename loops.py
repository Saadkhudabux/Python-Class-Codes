#Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied

#let's discuss while loop

# x = 0
# while x < 5:
#     print(x)
#     x = x + 1

# y = 10
# while y < 20:
#     print(y)
#     y = y + 1

# for loop

# days = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat"]

# for d in days:
#     if (d == "fri"):break
#     if (d == "fri"):continue
#     print(d)

# x = 3
# while x < 30:
#     print(x)
